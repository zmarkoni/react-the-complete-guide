MUST READ: Enabling CSS Modules
Don't skip this lecture - and keep it open in a separate browser tab when you go through the next lecture - sorry for the small inconvenience at this point!

In the next lecture, we'll use a styling solution named "CSS modules". I'll explain what it is and how it works over the next lectures.

The way we unlock it changed a little bit though.

In the next lecture, we'll eject from the project created with create-react-app (I'll show how that is done in the next lecture and that process will be exactly the same).

We'll then replace some code in a newly added webpack config file (it'll be available after ejecting).

In the video, I'll look for an entry that starts like this (in the webpack.config.js file):

{
  test: /\.css$/,
  ...
}
and I then edit this entry.

This entry now looks slightly different. You'll have to find the following part in your webpack.config.js file:

{
  test: cssRegex,
  exclude: cssModuleRegex,
  ...
}
and then edit that entry.

Finally, it should look like this:

{
  test: cssRegex,
  exclude: cssModuleRegex,
  use: getStyleLoaders({
      importLoaders: 1,
      modules: true,
      localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'
  }),
}
You can ignore me editing the webpack.config.prod.js file - with the latest version of create-react-app, ejecting only gives you ONE webpack config file (which you edit as described above).

Alternatively, you can now also use CSS modules without ejecting (you still can though, it won't be a problem). In a non-ejected project created with create-react-app, you can use CSS modules as described here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet
